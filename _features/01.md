The {{ site.sitename }} is an effort to link various beacon devices and various apps by the free and open combination like interactions with triggers and actions on [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

The standardized shared specification let beacons be able to tell what it is or what happened, to any nearby apps.

Dedicated beacon for a certain app and dedicated app for a certain beacon product are no longer necessary.
