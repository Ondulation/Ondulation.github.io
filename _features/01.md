The Ondulation is a suggestion of the standard specifications which link various beacon devices and various services by free and open combination like interactions with triggers and actions on [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

Dedicated beacon for the particular app nor dedicated app for the particular beacon product are not no longer required.

Our goal is that users can freely select beacon devices and services provided by different providers.
