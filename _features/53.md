Beacons also can be notified of the occurrence of the physical event. (the use and state of home appliances, the detection of sensors and so on)

And apps can record such physical event for later use, or notify remote user of the specific events.

For example, I put the sensor-beacons which send the detection by URL and put the gateway-device which receive these physical event, at my house. and I set the mobile app to receive these physical event too.  
If the home gateway receives these physical event which your mobile app does not receive, someone other than me is at home.
