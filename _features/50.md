It is good idea to provide the general-purpose app to handle any beacons based on this specification.

On these apps, user can choose the type of metadata as to be the trigger of the processing among the data-definitions on the context-store.

And they can define the execution condition of processing using the property specified in chosen data-definition.

So the specified processing is performed, when beacon of chosen type comes close to.

It is inspired by the chains of recipes on IFTTT.

Of course it is also good to provide the apps which specialized in the limited use and which are easy to operate.
