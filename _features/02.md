Attachments based on this specification are stored in arbitrary web document, and the beacon that support Eddystone-URL protocol broadcasts the URL of this document.

Any systems which receive beacon signal (such as mobile apps or stationary gateway devices), get the attachment data from web document, and they perform the action according to their own rules. They have control of what action they perform or do not.

Beacon deployers can't control the process triggered by receiving beacon, but their beacons can trigger variety of services around the world instead.

Of course the attachments may be stored in Google's Beacon Platform and retrieved via API, if the attachments are based on the specification.
