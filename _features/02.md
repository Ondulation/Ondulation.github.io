Metadata based on the {{ site.sitename }} specification is set to web document, and the beacon that support Eddystone-URL protocol broadcasts the URL of this document.
Or metadata is registered with Google Beacon Platform, and beacon broadcasts the UID associated with it.

The system (such as mobile apps or stationary gateway devices) which receives beacon get the metadata from web document, and they perform the action according to their own rules. They have control of what action they perform or do not.

Beacon deployers can't control the process triggered by receiving beacon, but their beacons can trigger variety of services around the world instead.
