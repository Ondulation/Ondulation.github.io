Metadata based on this specification are set on arbitrary web document, and the beacon that support Eddystone-URL protocol broadcasts the URL of this document.

Any systems which receive these beacon signal (such as mobile apps or stationary gateway devices), can get metadata from web document, and can understand them since these are based on the standard specification, and respond to beacon reception according to their own rules. They have control of what action they perform or do not.

This framework is not what enable the beacon deployers to control the triggered process, and is not suited to deliver complex data nor to cause an advanced processing.
This is intended to be what a simple semaphore is used as a starting point of the process from any systems.
