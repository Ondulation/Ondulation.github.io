Metadata based on this specification are set on arbitrary web document, and the beacon supporting Eddystone-URL protocol broadcasts the URL of this document.

Any systems which receive the URL from the beacon, can get metadata from web document, and can understand them since these are based on the standard specification, and respond to the signal in accordance with their own rules.
