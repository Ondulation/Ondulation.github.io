For the purpose of letting any beacon receiving system (such as mobile applications or stationary gateway devices) recognize what kind of data has been sent, we'll determine the specifications of the metadata for transaction between beacons and receiving systems.

This metadata is set on the web document, and the beacons that implement Eddystone-URL broadcast the url of the document.
Or the metadata is registered to Google's Beacon Platform, and the Beacons broadcast the UID associated with it.

The beacon receiving system get these metadata, and they perform the action according to their own rules. They have control of what action they perform or do not.

Beacon deployers can't control the process triggered by receiving beacon, but their beacons can trigger variety of services around the world instead.
