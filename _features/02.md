To let anyone know what kind of trigger is sent from the beacon, we'll determine the specifications of the metadata of trigger.

This metadata is set on the web document, and beacons send the url of this document.
Or the metadata is set on the google beacon platform, and beacon send the UID that is registered on beacon platform.

Mobile applications or gateway devices recieve these metadeta, and they decide what action they perform.

Beacon providers can't control the process, but their beacons can be used from a variety of services around the world instead.
