You can easily make the general-purpose app that can handle all beacons based on {{ site.sitename }}.

On such app, user can choose the type of data which they want to make into the trigger of the processing from the data-definitions on the context-store.

And they can define the execution condition of processing using the property specified in chosen data-definition. (like the chains of recipes on IFTTT)

Then the specified processing is performed, when beacon which broadcasts metadata of chosen type comes close to.

Of course it is also good to provide the apps which are easy to operate and which specialized in the limited use.
