The {{ site.sitename }} can alert the nearby deals based on the interest of the customer without dedicated beacon and app.

{@type: nearby deals} contains the properties to filter deals such as brand, product, target group, price range and so on.

The deals providers need only to publish the contents with {@type: nearby deals} metadata, and to broadcast the URL by the beacon.

The mobile apps that support {@type: nearby deals} enable their users to follow their interested deals.
