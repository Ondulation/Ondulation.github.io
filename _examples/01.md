This aids in filtering the notification caused by the beacon reception.

For the case that someone want to deliver the nearby deals only to the customers who will probably be interested in it, without dedicated beacon and app, we provide schema of the {@type: NearbyDeal}.

{@type: NearbyDeal} contains the properties to filter deals such as brand, product, target group, price range and so on.

The deals providers need only to publish the web contents with {@type: NearbyDeal} metadata, and to broadcast the URL by the beacon.

The mobile apps that support the {@type: NearbyDeal} enable users to follow the interested deals.
