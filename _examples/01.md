App to alert the nearby deals based on the interest of the customer, is already there.

If, however, you are trying to promote your products using these service, it is necessary to contract with service provider and to place a dedicated beacon. 
If you want to use more than one service, you seem to have to pay same number of costs.

Meanwhile Android Nearby Notifications can't filter the URLs.

By formulating a scheme of meta data for nearby deals, users can filter notifications by preference, such as brand or product or so on.

Dedicated beacon for a particular app nor dedicated app are not required for that.
