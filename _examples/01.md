The {{site.sitename}} aids in filtering the notification caused by the beacon reception.

For example, to deliver the nearby deals to the customers who will be interested in it, without dedicated beacon and app, we develop the schema of {@type: Deal}.

{@type: Deal} contains the properties to filter deals such as brand, product, target group, price range and so on.

The deals providers need only to publish the web contents with {@type: Deal} metadata, and to broadcast the URL by the beacon.

The mobile apps that support the {@type: Deal} enable users to receive the interested deals.
