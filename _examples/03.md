Beacons also can be notified of the occurrence of the physical event. (the use and state of home appliances, the detection of sensors and so on)

By transmitting the information in a prescribed format, it can be the trigger for the automatic action. (notification to the remote user, recording it for later use, and so on)

By using the beacons and a gateway sending the trigger to the server, you can watch over quietly your elderly parent living apart, or you can notice the trespassing onto your house.
