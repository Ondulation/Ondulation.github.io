Beacons also can be notified of the occurrence of the physical event. (the use and state of home appliances, the detection of sensors and so on)

And apps can record such physical event for later use, and notify remote user of the specific events.

For example, at the house that your elderly parent lives alone, you set up a gateway-device which send the received physical event to the server app, and set up sensors which send physical event, then you can quietly know whether he lives peacefully.
